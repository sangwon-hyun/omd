# Summary

Last time, we saw how experiments might apply to a checkerboard pattern
(global + local change).

Also, in `feb2-2021.Rmd`, we saw improvements in calculating Sinkhorn.

In this document, we conduct some experiments on the checkerboard pattern example.

(One residual question was: Why does transport go to 1 (and not 0) as the image
is coarsened? <-- solved)

# Experiments 

This is what smoothing does to the two mean matrices:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
n = 2^5 
M_mean = matrix(0, ncol = n, nrow=n)
sig = 1 
M1_mean = M_mean %>% add_global(2) %>% add_checkerboard(4, sig)  %>% add_checkerboard(8, sig) 
M2_mean = M_mean %>% add_global(2)
M1_mean = M1_mean + 5 
M2_mean = M2_mean + 5

## No smoothing, to highly smoothed means
for(d in c(2, 5, 10, 15, 31)){
  gridExtra::grid.arrange(M1_mean %>% smoothmat(d) %>% drawmat_precise(main = "Image 1"),
                          M2_mean %>% smoothmat(d) %>% drawmat_precise(main = "Image 2"),
                          ncol = 2,
                          top = paste0("Smoothing window size = ", d, "x", d))
} 
```

Now, visualizing two things, over a signal size (`sig`, which governs how prominent the checkerboard pattern is):

1. (LEFT panel of each row) The difference in the two mean matrices (no noise),
   generated as:
     + Take mean matrix 1 and 2.
     + Coarsen both by a window size of (d x d).
     + Measure the average of absolute pixel-wise difference.

2. (Middle panel of each row) The OMD of the mean matrices.
     + Take mean matrix 1 and 2.
     + Coarsen both by a window size of (d x d).
     + Calculate OMD between the two.

2. (RIGHT panel of each row) The OMD between the two noisy images:
     + Take mean matrix 1 and 2.
	 + Add N(0, 0.1) random noise to all pixels (to increase the difficulty of
       the problem).
     + Coarsen both noisy images by a window size of (d x d).
     + Measure the average of absolute pixel-wise difference.



```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=20}
## Setup: four different local pattern strengths.
sigs = c(0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2)

## Setup 3-column plots
par(mfrow = c(length(sigs), 2), oma = c(1,1,3,1))

for(sig in sigs){

  ## Generate mean
  M1_mean = M_mean %>% add_global(2) %>% add_checkerboard(4, sig)  %>% add_checkerboard(8, sig) 
  M2_mean = M_mean %>% add_global(2)
  M1_mean = M1_mean + 5
  M2_mean = M2_mean + 5

  ## Window sizes
  sizes = seq(from = 1, to = 32, by=1)

  ## Calculate difference in the means
  diff_in_means = sapply(sizes, function(d){
    pixelwise_diff <- smoothmat(M1_mean, d) - smoothmat(M2_mean, d)
    mean(pixelwise_diff^2)
  })
  diff_in_means %>% plot(type = 'o', x = sizes, xlab = "Window size",
                         ylab = "avg. of absolute pixel-wise differences")
  abline(v = c(4, 8), lty = 2)


  ## Calculate OMD between the means
  omd_in_means = sapply(sizes, function(d){
    ## pixelwise_diff <- smoothmat(M1_mean, d) - smoothmat(M2_mean, d)
    ## mean(abs(pixelwise_diff))
    omd(smoothmat(M1_mean, d), smoothmat(M2_mean, d),
        type = "transport")$dist
  })
  omd_in_means %>% plot(type = 'o', x = sizes, xlab = "Window size",
                         ylab = "OMD between the matrices")
  abline(v = c(4, 8), lty = 2)
  
  
  next

  ## Generate noisy data
  sigma = 0.1
  nsim = 4

  ## Now, as a function of coarsening, we want to see the trend of OMD.
  dists_list = list() 
  sizes = seq(from=1, to=32, by=1)
  for(ii in 1:length(sizes)){
    d = sizes[ii]
    dists = mclapply(1:nsim, function(isim){
      res <- omd((M1_mean + rnorm(length(M1_mean), 0, sigma)) %>% smoothmat(d),
                 (M2_mean + rnorm(length(M2_mean), 0, sigma)) %>% smoothmat(d),
                 type = "transport")
      return(res$dist)
    }, mc.cores = 4)

                      xlab="Data smoothing window\n left=fine, right=coarse",
                      ylab = "OMD", pch=16,
                      x = sizes)
  
  apply(distmat, 1, mean) %>% lines(type='o', lwd=3, col='black',
                                      xlab="Data smoothing window\n left=fine, right=coarse",

# Next steps

- Use optimality conditions of the Sinkhorn convex optimization problem as a
  stopping rule.

- Investigate what's going on with the later (coarsen window 24-32) parts of the
  plots.

- Change the global pattern to also shift a bit.

- Make the explanation slightly clearer.

- Investigate the L1 Wasserstein Wavelet paper
  (https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~ssameer/Research/Papers/WEMD_CVPR08.pdf) and
  another Fourier-based method (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06530.pdf). Christian
  will look into (Matlab) code that exists.

- (Send Bror the scripts, after cleaning a little bit)

- Visualize the transports.
